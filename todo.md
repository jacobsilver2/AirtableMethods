# Airtable For Pete's Candy Store


## Methods To Update

---

>It's probably a good idea to start thinking about just making some general functions which accept other functions as input, which can be imported into other files.

## addEvent.js

- [x] After adding new event, ask user if they want to add an act.
- [x] User enters act email address (act name will be inferred from event name), a search is performed based on act name and email, if a value is returned, the user will be presented a list of returned values and choose which act to add.  If no values are returned, the act will be added to the database as a new act, and linked to the event.
